"aLipi" means without-alphabet or text/print-impaired (non-literates/low-literates).

lipi means alphabet, letter, writing or script in Sanskrit. The "a" sound as a prefix is mostly used as negation in Sanskrit and many Indian languages. We also use the phrase "aLipi - God's own content" to present re-narration as a suitable method to provide content accessibility for all.
