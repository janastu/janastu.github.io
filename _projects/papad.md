An application designed to listen and tag audio files by a CR station community. These tags (the meta information) can then be used to search, sort and share a large collection of audio files â€“ eg., when community calls a CR station and leaves messages in large numbers, or when a CR Station wants to put their program content out so that the community can listen to it and also categorize it for their own convenience. To quote in one line, the tool is a community-oriented content curation for audio files.
