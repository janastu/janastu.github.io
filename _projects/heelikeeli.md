**Objectives**

The **first** is substantive and obvious: we are enabling real connectivity and information sharing among two under-recognised cohorts of the digital divide: non-literates, and girls and young women.  The **second** is to make these tools accessible and familiar, by demystifying the technology for underexposed communities.  The **third** is to place the means of communication outside the for-profit marketplace that has mostly consumed internet platforms and appropriated and commodified content.  All the devices, software, and tools that will be used and developed are open source.  We utilize only interactive platforms that are easily available, such as common web browsers, Raspberry Pi and smartphones.

The **fourth** and final aim is to stimulate meaningful participation within the local ecosystem. While the instantaneous, global reach of the internet is perhaps its most spectacular achievement, these tools help neophytes to connect locally and to engage deeply at a relatively small scale.

Humans are the animals who tell stories.  We share information and ideas within and among communities.  We talk to each other; and we always have.  Over millena, we have enlisted technologies to assist in this basic desire to communicate.  Published writing, sound recording, and most recently video are common manifestations of the same, elemental impulse to speak and be heard -- and to listen to what others have to say.  The web and new telecommunication technologies have proven to be quickly adopted platforms that amplify and democratize these media. Once we see these platforms within the context of this natural continuity, we can emphasize and reinforce:

Talking as a way to publish 
Listening as a way to discover
Storytelling as a way to nourish
Seeing as a way to socialize
Interaction as a way to livelihoods
Making as a way of self determination
Re-narration as a way to interconnect
Creativity as a way to be responsive
...

When internet tools are made accessible to an unserved cohort, we invariably see a rapid flow of creative input that deeply enriches not only that specific community, but encourages more broad participation as well.  We fully expect that development of tools in support of meaningful non-literate participation will provide traction for other under-served populations -- for example,  the elderly; or perhaps people who donâ€™t fit neatly into a recognized category or cohort -- to begin to engage constructively in this essential platform of social, cultural, and intellectual communication.  ***Inclusivity breeds inclusivity.***

The other community for whom our solution will unlock opportunity is girls and young women, who come from social backgrounds that have limited their access to public platforms of influence generally and media platforms specifically.  For them, the internet accessibility we aim to provide can serve as an invaluable alternative to more traditional forums of social influence.  And, of course, the internet is rapidly outpacing these older platforms in impact and importance.  

We seek to expand their experience in one other extremely significant way.  Our program recognises not only the ability of the internet to give voice, but also the ability to preserve and sustain that voice.  In the context of the specific communities of our target female participants, girls have always had the ability to speak and share ideas among themselves.  This activity is prolific, although it tends to be confined to a limited, proximal physical space.  Leaving the broad reach of the internet aside, and continuing to focus on the rich opportunities within purely local participation, we believe the archival aspect of the web can contribute profoundly to this natural flow of communication.  Their ideas are not only preserved; like other systems of accessible information, they become launching-pads for more expansive, derivative, and syncretic ideas.  Their knowledge becomes a catalyst for new creativity.

During this year, at Mirzapur, young girls will be introduced to tiny, independent, recording devices that are also connected to other devices locally and to local servers and services. Young women get to talk, listen, story tell and socialize whereby they interconnect, discover others and become the voice of the community. They also become part of the community which owns and operates the mesh over time. As the larger community realizes that their interventions help benefit the local economy, in addition to these skills serving better the interests of those who aspire to find jobs elsewhere, the community and the local panchayats are likely to encourage and help sustain these activities.

The project partners -- *DA, Medha, and Janastu* -- are committed to reaching-out within their networks, to bring a broader range of devices, services, technical resources, and community assets to the development of decentralised mesh contexts.
