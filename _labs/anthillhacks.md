title: Anthillhacks
---

AntHill is a metaphor for the world of structure and complexity that exists just beneath the surface of everything around us. And Ants are our inspiration which embodies co-operation, coordination and communication as core principles of building communities.

The idea of Anthillhacks is to encourage people to meet at a smaller hills nearby and include it in the program (the place matters). And the idea of Anthillhacks is to be inclusive of City folks, of village folks, of women and non-binary, of educated and the low-literate to get to participate and be together.

Imagine groups of people from different domains living together for a period of time.. The location itself brings about an intermingling of thought-systems that would not have interacted otherwise. This inspires collaborations giving birth to eye-opening new productions and curation of existing narratives and annotations of real world objects at the location.

We invite Artists, Hackers, Technology freaks, Environmentalists, Scientists, Culture Benders and other community stewards and their friends and family to come together, co-operate, build, break, hack together and party like the “Ants”

Wifi-mesh, set up here, covers some villages, forest areas, historic sites and the hack camps of the anthill. Servers and services are deployed locally on the mesh with a weak data connection to the Internet. Mesh incentivises trekking or choosing attractive spots in the area to work closely with each other while staying connected to the group as a whole.


### CULTURE

"The hacker culture is a subculture of individuals who enjoy the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming limitations of systems to achieve novel and clever outcomes. The act of engaging in activities (such as programming or other media) in a spirit of playfulness and exploration is termed 'hacking' "

Anthillhacks is inclusive and calls upon every participant to be Excellent to Each Other.
